# Mayckon Giovani  
### Principal Systems Engineer • Distributed Systems • Post-Quantum Infrastructure

I design and harden security-critical systems under adversarial conditions.

My work operates at the intersection of:

- Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Distributed Financial Infrastructure
- Blockchain Protocol Engineering
- Secure IIoT Communication
- High-Performance Rust Backends
- Zero-Trust Architecture

I don’t focus on shipping features.

I focus on enforcing invariants.

## 🧭 Engineering Doctrine

Systems fail at boundaries.

My approach:

- Define invariants first
- Model failure surfaces explicitly
- Assume adversarial actors
- Design for asymmetric degradation
- Engineer for long-horizon maintainability

---

## 🔬 Current Focus Areas

- Post-Quantum Key Exchange & Signature Systems (Kyber / Falcon)
- Deterministic State Machines for Financial Ledgers
- Protocol-level Attack Surface Analysis
- Failure Models & Partial Partition Tolerance
- Zero-Knowledge Execution Models
- Cryptographic Infrastructure for Hostile Environments
- Memory-constrained systems (`no_std`, heapless Rust)
